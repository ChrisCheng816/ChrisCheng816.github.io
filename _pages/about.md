Welcome to my homepage!

I'm a first year Ph.D student from [Department of Computer Science](https://www.wm.edu/as/computerscience/), [W&M](https://www.wm.edu/). My research interests are mainly related to AI4SE (Artificial Intelligence for Software Engineering), including research on code-related tasks such as code generation, code repair, and code translation. 

Before that, I earned my BSc in Computer Science from the [University of Birmingham](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/) (UK) with First Class Honours in 2022 and my MSc in Advanced Computer Science from the [University of Manchester](https://www.manchester.ac.uk/) (UK) with Distinction in 2024.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Mastropaolo](https://antoniomastropaolo.com/) of [AURA Lab](https://aura-se-lab.github.io/).
